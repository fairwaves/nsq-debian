Usage:
    nsq stat [<topic> [<channel>]]
        watch nsqd stats (possibly filtered by topic/channel) updated each second
        ctrl+C to exit

    nsq tail <topic> [<limit>]
        get a live stream for a given topic, at most <limit> messages if present
        (utilizes ephemeral channel, so no cleanup is necessary)

    nsq create <topic> [<channel>]
        create a topic or channel
        not terribly useful, as they are created on demand when pushing or pulling

    nsq delete <topic> [<channel>]
        drop a topic or channel, along with all the messages

    nsq empty <topic> [<channel>]
        drain a topic or a channel

    nsq pause <topic> [<channel>]
        pause messages going from topic to its channels, or from channel to its clients

    nsq unpause <topic> [<channel>]
        unpause previously paused topic or channel

    nsq version
        get nsqd version
